        <h2>About Atlanta</h2>
        <p>Atlanta is an <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/golden-retriever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AKC</a> registered, 20 month old, part english cream <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Retriever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">golden retriever</a>. She has a light coat with a golden shade on top. We got her as a puppy and she has been the best companion dog ever since.<br> She is however, nothing more as far as dog roles go. She is a little too crazy to be a service or therapy dog, and too big and goofy to be a show dog. But as a companion, she is perfect and her one job is "ball". She is very good at her job.</p>
        <h2><a id=atlanta_care>The Essentials</a></h2>
        <h3>Schedule</h3>
        <p>Atlanta Eats 2 times a day, once in the morning, and once at night. She needs to go out at least 3 times a day, she'll let you know if she needs more.<br>
        Her Schedule is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Breakfast after waking up</li>
            <li>Take her out to the bathroom</li>
            <li>Another bathroom break around noon</li>
            <li>Depending on the season, a trip to the dog park (later in the day during summer)</li>
            <li>Dinner around 9 pm</li>
            <li>One last bathroom break before bed</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>Atlanta is a very lazy pup, but loves to get out and explore whenever you want to. She loves walking, hiking and most importantly <strong>FETCH</strong>.</p>
            <dt>Where do I take her on walks?</dt>
                <dd>In the neighborhood or to a park, she must be leashed.</dd>
            <dt>Where can I take her for a treat?</dt>
                <dd>Anywhere that serves pup cups. If you go somewhere for morning coffee, get a treat for yourself too</dd>
            <dt>Where can I take her to play fetch?</dt>
                <dd>You can take her to any park off leash and she won't wander as long as you are playing fetch with her. She will be laser focused on the ball.</dd>
        <p>Her favorite place for fetch is the dog park:</p>
        <address>Art Dye Dog Park 1000 N 550 E St,<br> American Fork, UT 84003</address>
